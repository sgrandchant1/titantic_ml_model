# titantic_ml_model
Kaggle challenge to predict which passengers survived the Titanic Crash. 

Used scikit-learn library to create a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict surviving passengers of the Titanic. Data shows women had around a 75% chance of surviving the accident while men had only around a 25% chance.

# Libraries used:
the following are the libraries used for the project:
  1. Pandas: data curating and data validating as well as data exploration
  2. scikit-learn: create the Decision Tree model, split data into test and train, get accuracy of model
  3. numpy: perform mathematical operations on the data
  4. seaborn: visualize and perform analysis on data
  5. matplotlib: visualize data.

# Insights and Results
Obtained consisten results at a 82% accuracy rate predicting surviving passengers. scikit-learn is a simple, easy to use library to create machine learning models.
